# Portfolio Site Using React

## About
This portfolio site is a work in progress.  I liked the design of the portfolio that I forked this project from, 
but felt that the pure HTML/CSS implementation was a bit difficult to work with.

To make this portfolio easier for others in the future to edit I decided to try out a more modern web development
approach and use React.  I completely wiped the directory and used the example portfolio as a visual template for how
I wanted the new project to look.  I hope that others may find this useful and improve further on what I've done.

## Updating content for your portfolio
I tried my best to structure all the custom content as JSON.  So for the most part all you should have to do is look 
for the JSON structures in the code and modify them to suit your needs.
